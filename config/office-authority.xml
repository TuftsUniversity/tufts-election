             <br>Historical Note:  These elections were vastly different from modern day Presidential elections.  The actual Presidential candidates were rarely mentioned on tickets and voters were voting for particular electors who were pledged to a particular candidate.  There was sometimes confusion as to who the particular elector was actually pledged to.  Prior to the 12th Amendment, electors were pledged to two candidates as there was no distinction made in the Electoral College between President and Vice-President.</br>

Through the history of the First State, the Levy Court took many forms with varying degrees of power and authority. The Levy Court serves the same function as a county council and consists of seven elected commissioners. One commissioner is elected from each of the six Levy Court districts and one commissioner is elected at large. These commissioners represent the governing body of the county and hold weekly business and committee meetings which are open to the public.
