          <dt class="question">What am I searching for?</dt>
      <dd><p>Your results might include both <em>elections</em> and
      <em>candidates</em>. An election will give you the results for an
      election that takes place on a date, for a single office, in a single
      jurisdiction. A candidate result will give you the candidate's full
      name and a link to all of the elections featuring that candidate.</p></dd>

      <!-- searches are a lot faster in the new engine; let's leave this out
           for now in the hopes that it won't be necessary.
          
      <p><span class="question">My search is running slow.  What should I do?</span>
             <ul>
                <li>The keyword search function is examining over 17,000 elections in full text. It may take a few moments to process. 
                   </li>
               <li>Try to narrow your search to a specific state.  Searches within states are
                   much faster than searches across the entire dataset.</li>
               <li>Avoid keyword searches when more specific fields can be used instead. Prefer to use the candidate field, year field, office field, or the like on the advanced search page; searches using these fields will run faster.</li>
               <li>Use browsing instead, if appropriate.  You can browse by year, by state, by
                   office name, or by candidate name.  If you are looking for records that
                   are grouped together in any of these ways, head to the <a href="/">home page</a>
                   to browse.</li>
                <li>If you are having significant problems obtaining search results, please contact Tufts University.</li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      -->

          <dt class="question">Can I use Boolean searching?</dt>
          <dd><p>Yes. Permissible operators are
             <ul>
                <li><strong>"</strong> [double quotation mark]: to define an
		exact string. For example, if you wanted elections only for John
		Quincy Adams and not for his father, John Adams, as well, the
		search would look like this: <pre>"John Quincy Adams"</pre>
		Without the quotation marks, you would get all elections where
		there was someone named John or Quincy or Adams.  </li>
                <li><strong>-</strong> [minus sign]: to specify that the next word is not in the search string </li>
                <li><strong>+</strong> [plus sign]: to specify that  both words must be in the search string (this is the default behavior) </li>
              </ul>
          </p></dd>

          <dt class="question">Capitalization: Are the searches case
	  sensitive?</dt>
          <dd><p>Keyword searches are NOT case sensitive. Thus Senator, senator,
	  and SeNaTOr will all yield the same results.</p></dd>

          <!-- I'm not sure we currently have a way to do this. We should
	  install the advanced search plug-in if we want this behavior.
          <dt class="question">How do I search for a range of years?</dt>
          <dd><p>Next to the word year, use the first drop-down box to indicate the first year of your range and use the second drop-down box to indicate the last year of your range. Thus, if you are looking for elections held from 1812 to 1816, use<br />
             <pre><img alt="1812   1816" src="assets/1812.gif" /></pre>
             For just one year put the same year in both boxes<br />
             <pre><img alt="1820   1820" src="assets/1820.gif" /></pre>
             The years will automatically default to the time period of these
	     data, 1787-1825</dt>
	     -->

          <dt class="question">How can I search by the type of office?</dt>
          <dd><p>Expand the "Office"facet in the left-hand navigation and select
	  the office name. The facet list contains a controlled list of office
	  names for all of the states. The states had various different names
	  for their legislative bodies. For example, one of New York's
	  legislative bodies is called the Assembly. So if you search for New
	  York and House of Representative you will not find any elections. For
	  more information about the states and their offices, please browse the
	  state pages.</p></dd>

          <dt class="question">How do I search by candidate name?</dt>
          <dd><p>You either browse by last name or search for the name. If you
	  would like to browse, look underneath the search box on the homepage
	  for "Browse by Candidate". Please keep in mind that the names in the
	  XML are entered given name first and family name last. Also note that
	  the spellings of names were not regularized during this period in
	  history. As a result, one newspaper may spell a candidate’s name one
	  way, and another source may spell the name in a completely different
	  way. Whenever possible, we have tried to give the authoritative names
	  for candidates.</p></dd>

          <dt class="question">How do I search by party?</dt>
          <dd><p>You can expand the "Party" facet in the left-hand navigation to
	  see a controlled list of party affiliations and coalitions. The party
	  affiliations given in the election record are those that were recorded
	  in the contemporary newspapers. Elections where Mr. Lampi did not indicate
	  the party affiliation of a candidate will not have an affiliation and
	  will not be found in a search.</p></dd>

          <dt class="question">How do I search for elections in a certain
	  place?</dt>
         <dd><p>If you would like to search for elections held in a certain place,
	 you have two options. You may type the name in the keyword box or use
	 the state facet. If the geographic name you are looking for is not
	 included in the drop box, then either we do not yet have data available
	 for that place or the place may have been gone by a different name
	 during this time period. Much of the authoritative listing of historic
	 geography still needs to be done. For information on historic
	 geography, visit the <a
	 href="http://www.newberry.org/ahcbp/atlasabout.html">Newberry Library’s
	 Atlas of Historic County Boundaries</a>.</p></dd>

          <dt class="question">Why can't I find Somerville, Massachusetts or
	  Manhattan?</dt>
         <dd><p>The geographic names are those that were used for places at a
	 specific time in American history. Somerville was part of Charlestown
	 until 1842 and thus will not yield any results.  Similarly, all results
	 from Maine prior to 1820 will be found under Massachusetts. There will
	 also be results from places that no longer exist such as Greenwich,
	 Massachusetts which now sits beneath the Quabbin Reservoir or
	 Dorchester, Massachusetts which was a separate city until being annexed
	 by Boston in 1870. You may need to do some preliminary research to
	 learn about these historic places.</p></dd>

        <dt class="question">What are these "facets" over on the left, and how can I use them to help me search?</dt>
        <dd><p><p>Facets provide a method to intuitively see how to refine your search results.</p>

	<p>Once you have made a search, you can expand the facets on the left to
	narrow your search by state or territory, year, office, jurisdiction,
	party, or election type. Once you have expanded the facets, you will see
	that the available options are listed, with each link followed by a
	number in parentheses indicating how many elections meet that
	criterion.</p> 

	<p>For example, let's say I search for "Adams." If I make that search
	today, I will get 571 results. However, if I expand the "State" facet, I
	see that only eight of those results are from Kentucky. If I select the
	"Kentucky" facet it will be much easier for me to find the election I'm
	seeking. Now my elections are updated to show only results from
	Kentucky.</p>


	<p>A single search can have multiple facets. For example, perhaps I am
	searching for "Adams" in Pennsylvania. I see that there are 182
	elections in the Pennsylvania facet for Adams; that is still a lot of
	elections to examine. I can select the "Pennsylvania" facet to start
	narrowing my search, and I will now see under the search box that I have
	chosen the "Adams" and "Pennsylvania" facets. (I can remove any of these
	facets from my search at any time by selecting the "x" to the right of
	the facet name.) Now I have 182 elections to search through. If I expand
	"Office" in the left-hand navigation, I can narrow it to "Commissioner"
	-- that still gets me 30 elections -- and now I can expand the year
	facet in the left-hand navigation bar and narrow it by "1804". At this
	point there are only two possible choices! For people named "Adams" who
	ran in Pennsylvania in 1804 for the office of Commissioner, we have only
	two elections available.</p>
  
	<p>You can even use the facets to browse. From the homepage, expand the
	facet choices in the left-hand navigation and select the area you'd like
	to browse. For example, if you expand the "Party" link you can select
	"Quid" in order to browse through all of the elections which use the
	"Quid" party identification.</p></p></dd>
